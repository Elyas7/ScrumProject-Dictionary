Dear All,

Kindly share your comments regarding the user stories here!

As a user
I want to rate the dictionary after using it
so that the developers could update dictionary based on my feedback
As the Product Owner I need to know which User Stories are feasible for you and which are not. 
I have gathered 10 User Stories, please read each one of them carefully and then comment back here that which one is Ok with you and which one is not. 

For instance this is one of the User Stories that I think should be considered for making the software: 

Title: Dictionary           Priority: High          Estimate: 5 Minutes
As a Computer Science Student
I want to search for words that are widely used in IT field. Mostly CS terminologies
so that I can better know and understand what are their meaning in a technical context
